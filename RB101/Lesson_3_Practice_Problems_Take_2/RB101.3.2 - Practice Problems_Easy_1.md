# Practice Problems: Easy 1
[RB101.3.2](https://launchschool.com/lessons/263069da/assignments/e2593fe1)

## 1. What would you expect the code below to print out?

```ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 2, 4]
numbers.uniq

puts numbers
```

This will return a new array `[1, 2, 2, 4]` as `Array#uniq` returns a new array of all elements that are not duplicates in a collection. However this return value was not assigned to a variable and the method call was not destructive so on the last line the call to `Kernel#puts` will print 1 2 2 4 on separate lines to screen as the values referenced by `numbers` collection has not changed. (The `Kernel#puts` method calls `to_s` on its argument and then writes each element to a new line)

If we had used `p` instead of `puts` we would have called `inspect` on the argument and output `[1, 2, 2, 3]`.

## 2. Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:

1. what is `!=` and where should you use it?
2. put `!` before something, like `!user_name`
3. put `!` after something, like `words.uniq!`
4. put `?` before something
5. put `?` after something
6. put `!!` before something, like `!!user_name`

The `!` typically has two uses in ruby. One is a convention standard regarding naming methods. Typically a method name ending with a `!` will be destructive/mutating. The other use is for convey `not`. `!=` is the not equal to operator.

The `?` in ruby also has two uses. One is in method naming. A method ending in `?` is typically, though not always going to return a boolean value, as per convention. Whether it really does is up to the actual method implementation. Secondly `? : ` is the if...else ternary operator.

1. As stated `!=` is the not equal to operator. This is used in control flow logic or where boolean evaluations are need to set something not equal to or check if an object is not equal to something.
2. `!` used before an object will turn it into its boolean opposite.
   `!8 #=> false` or `!nil #=> true` or `!true #=> false`
3. Typically a method name followed by `!` will be destructive/mutating. This is not always the case
4. This is the ternary operator for if...else
5. may indicate that the method will return a binary value
6. `!!` used before an object will turn it into its boolean equivalent
   `!!8 #=> true` or `!!nil #=> false` or `!!true #=> true`


## 3. Replace the word "important" with "urgent" in this string:
`advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur."`

```ruby
def replace_word(string)
  new_string = string.split
  new_string[6] = 'urgent'
  new_string.join(" ")
end

advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur."
p replace_word(advice)
```
or

```ruby
p advice.sub('important', 'urgent')
#or
p advice.gsub('important', 'urgent')
```

or

```ruby
p advice.replace("Few things in life are as urgent as house training your pet dinosaur.")
```

or

```ruby
def replace_word(string)
  new_advice = string.split
  changing_index = new_advice.index("important")
  new_advice.delete_at(changing_index)
  new_advice.insert(changing_index, "urgent").join(" ")
end

advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur."
p replace_word(advice)
```

## 4. The Ruby Array class has several methods for removing items from the array. Two of them have very similar names. Let's see how they differ. What do the following method calls do (assume we reset numbers to the original array between method calls)?

`numbers.delete_at(1)`
`numbers.delete(1)`

```ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.delete_at(1) # => 2
numbers # => [1, 3, 4, 5]
```
```ruby
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.delete(1) # => 1
numberss # => [2, 3, 4, 5]
```
`Array#delete_at` deletes the element at a given integer index argument and returns the deleted object. It is a destructive method

`Array#delete` deletes the element that is `==` a given object argument and returns the deleted object. It is also destructive.

## 5. Programmatically determine if 42 lies between 10 and 100.

```ruby
(10..100).include?(42) # => true
(10..100) === 42 # => true
(10..100).cover?(42) # => true
```

## 6. Show two different ways to put the expected "Four score and " in front of the given string

```ruby
famous_words = "seven years ago..."

# 1
famous_words.insert(0, "Four score and ")

# 2
famous_words.prepend("Four score and ")

# 3
famous_words = "Four score and " << famous_words

# 4
famous_words = "Four score and " + famous_words
```

## 7. Un-nest the given nested array

```ruby
flintstones = ["Fred", "Wilma"]
flintstones << ["Barney", "Betty"]
flintstones << ["BamBam", "Pebbles"]

# => ["Fred", "Wilma", ["Barney", "Betty"], ["BamBam", "Pebbles"]]

flintstones.flatten!
```

## 8. Turn this into an array containing only two elements: Barney's name and Barney's number

```ruby
flintstones = { "Fred" => 0, "Wilma" => 1, "Barney" => 2, "Betty" => 3, "BamBam" => 4, "Pebbles" => 5 }

# 1
flintstones.assoc("Barney")

# 2
barney = flintstones.select { |k, v| k == "Barney" }
barney = barney.to_a.flatten

# 3
array = []
flintstones.each do |k, v|
  if k == "Barney"
    array << k 
    array << v
  end
end
array

# 4 (Destructively)
flintstones.delete_if {|key, value| key != "Barney"}
flintstones.to_a.flatten!
```
