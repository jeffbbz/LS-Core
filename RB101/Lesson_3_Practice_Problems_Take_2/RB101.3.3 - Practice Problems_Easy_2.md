# Practice Problems: Easy 2
[RB101.3.3](https://launchschool.com/lessons/263069da/assignments/86725689)

## 1. In this hash of people and their age, see if "Spot" is present.
Bonus: What are two other hash methods that would work just as well for this solution?

```ruby
ages = { "Herman" => 32, "Lily" => 30, "Grandpa" => 402, "Eddie" => 10 }

ages.key?("Spot")

# Bonus
ages.include?("Spot")
ages.member?("Spot")
ages.any? { |k,_| k == "Spot" }
```

## 2. Starting with this string: Convert the string in the following ways(code will be executed on original munsters_description):

a. `"tHE mUNSTERS ARE CREEPY IN A GOOD WAY."`

```ruby
munsters_description = "The Munsters are creepy in a good way."

# 1
munsters_description.swapcase!

# 2
munsters_description.upcase!.sub!("T", "t").sub!("M", "m")
```

b. `"The munsters are creepy in a good way."`

```ruby
munsters_description = "The Munsters are creepy in a good way."

munsters_description.capitalize!
```

c. `"the munsters are creepy in a good way."`

```ruby
munsters_description = "The Munsters are creepy in a good way."

munsters_description.downcase!
```

d. `"THE MUNSTERS ARE CREEPY IN A GOOD WAY."`

```ruby
munsters_description = "The Munsters are creepy in a good way."

munsters_description.upcase!
```

## 3. We have most of the Munster family in our age hash, add ages for Marilyn and Spot to the existing hash

```ruby
ages = { "Herman" => 32, "Lily" => 30, "Grandpa" => 5843, "Eddie" => 10 }
additional_ages = { "Marilyn" => 22, "Spot" => 237 }

# 1
ages.merge!(additional_ages)

# 2
ages.update(additional_ages)
```

## 4. See if the name "Dino" appears in the string below

```ruby
advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur."

# 1
advice.include?("Dino")

# 2
advice.match?("Dino")
advice.match?(/Dino/)

# 3
(advice =~ /Dino/) != nil

# 4
advice.index("Dino") != nil
```

## 5. Show an easier way to write this array:
`flintstones = ["Fred", "Barney", "Wilma", "Betty", "BamBam", "Pebbles"]`

```ruby
flintstones = %w(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)
```

## 6. How can we add the family pet "Dino" to our usual array:
`flintstones = %w(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)`

```ruby
# 1
flintstones << "Dino"

# 2
flintstones.push("Dino")

# 3
flintstones.append("Dino")

# 4
flintstones.insert(-1, "Dino")

# 5 To the Beginning
flintstones.unshift("Dino")
```

## 7. How can we add multiple items to our array? (Dino and Hoppy)
`flintstones = %w(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)`

```ruby
# 1
flintstones.concat(["Dino", "Hoppy"])

# 2
flintstones.push("Dino", "Hoppy")

# 3 To the Beginning
flintstones.unshift("Dino", "Hoppy")

# 4
flintstones.insert(-1, "Dino", "Hoppy")
```

## 8. Shorten the following sentence:
`advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur."`

*Review the String#slice! documentation, and use that method to make the return value "Few things in life are as important as ". But leave the advice variable as "house training your pet dinosaur.".*

Bonus: what happens if you use the String#slice method instead?

```ruby
advice = "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur."

advice.slice!("Few things in life are as important as ")

# or 

advice.slice!(0, advice.index('house'))
```

Bonus Answer: If you use `String#slice` instead you will not mutate the string object referenced by the local variable `advice` but the return value of the `String#slice` invocation will be the same as using `String#slice!`.

## 9. Write a one-liner to count the number of lower-case 't' characters in the following string: `statement = "The Flintstones Rock!"`

```ruby
statement = "The Flintstones Rock!"
statement.count("t")
```

## 10. Back in the stone age (before CSS) we used spaces to align things on the screen. If we had a table of Flintstone family members that was forty characters in width, how could we easily center that title above the table with spaces?: `title = "Flintstone Family Members"`

```ruby
title = "Flintstone Family Members"
title.center(40)
```
