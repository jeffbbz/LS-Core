# Practice Problems: Methods and More Methods
[RB101.5.5](https://launchschool.com/lessons/c53f2250/assignments/f524e910)

## 1. Order array string elements by descending numeric value

```ruby
arr = ['10', '11', '9', '7', '8']

# with #sort_by

arr.sort_by { |string| -string.to_i }

# with #sort

arr.sort { |a, b| b.to_i <=> a.to_i }
```



## 2. Order array of hashes based on year of publication of book, early to late

```ruby
books = [
  {title: 'One Hundred Years of Solitude', author: 'Gabriel Garcia Marquez', published: '1967'},
  {title: 'The Great Gatsby', author: 'F. Scott Fitzgerald', published: '1925'},
  {title: 'War and Peace', author: 'Leo Tolstoy', published: '1869'},
  {title: 'Ulysses', author: 'James Joyce', published: '1922'}
]

# with #sort_by

books.sort_by {|book| book[:published] }

# with #sort

books.sort { |a, b| a[:published] <=> b[:published]}
```



## 3. Reference the letter 'g'

```ruby
arr1 = ['a', 'b', ['c', ['d', 'e', 'f', 'g']]]

arr1[2][1][3]

arr2 = [{first: ['a', 'b', 'c'], second: ['d', 'e', 'f']}, {third: ['g', 'h', 'i']}]

arr2[1][:third][0]

arr3 = [['abc'], ['def'], {third: ['ghi']}]

arr3[2][:third][0][0]

hsh1 = {'a' => ['d', 'e'], 'b' => ['f', 'g'], 'c' => ['h', 'i']}

hsh1["b"][1]

hsh2 = {first: {'d' => 3}, second: {'e' => 2, 'f' => 1}, third: {'g' => 0}}

hsh2[:third].key(0)
```



## 4. Change the 3s to 4s

```ruby
arr1 = [1, [2, 3], 4]

arr1[1][1] = 4
p arr1

arr2 = [{a: 1}, {b: 2, c: [7, 6, 5], d: 4}, 3]

arr2[2] = 4
p arr2

hsh1 = {first: [1, 2, [3]]}

hsh1[:first][2][0] = 4
p hsh1

hsh2 = {['a'] => {a: ['1', :two, 3], b: 4}, 'b' => 5}

hsh2[['a']][:a][2] = 4
p hsh2
```



## 5. What is the total age of the male family members?

```ruby
munsters = {
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
}

# with #sum

munsters.sum {|_, v| v["gender"] == "male" ? v["age"] : 0 }

# or with #values and #each

sum = 0
munsters.values.each { |hash| sum += hash["age"] if hash["gender"] == "male" }
sum
```



## 6. Print name, age and gender of family members

```none
(Name) is a (age)-year-old (male or female).
```

```ruby
munsters = {
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
}

munsters.each do |name, info|
  puts "#{name} is a #{info["age"]}-year-old #{info["gender"]}."
end
```



## 7. what are the final values of a and b? And the arr

```ruby
a = 2
b = [5, 8]
arr = [a, b]

arr[0] += 2
arr[1][0] -= a

# arr => [4, [3, 8]]
# a => 2
# b => [3, 8]

```

`a` still references `2` because it has not be re-assigned and its value has not (and cannot be) mutated. `b` references an array collection object however, which can be mutated. And it was mutated when element re-assignment was done on line 6. `b` references the same array as on line 2 but the first element is now `3`.



## 8. Using the `each` method, write some code to output all of the vowels from the strings.

```ruby
hsh = {
  first:  ['the', 'quick'], 
  second: ['brown', 'fox'], 
  third:  ['jumped'], 
  fourth: ['over', 'the', 'lazy', 'dog']
}

hsh.each_value do |val_arr|
  val_arr.each do |word|
    word.chars.each do |char|
      print char if %(aeiou).include?(char)
    end
  end
end
```



## 9. Return a new array with same structure with sub arrs ordered in descending order

```ruby
arr = [['b', 'c', 'a'], [2, 1, 3], ['blue', 'black', 'green']]

arr.map { |sub_arr| sub_arr.sort { |a, b| b <=> a } }
```



## 10. Use map to return a new identical array structure with each value incremented by 1. Do not modify the original array

```ruby
arr = [{a: 1}, {b: 2, c: 3}, {d: 4, e: 5, f: 6}]

# with #each_with_object

arr.map do |hash|
  hash.each_with_object({}) do |(k, v), new_hash|
    new_hash[k] = v + 1
  end
end

# or with Hash#transform_values

arr.map do |hash| 
  hash.transform_values { |value| value + 1 }
end
```

This will return `[1, nil, nil]`. `map` returns a new array of elements that are the return values of successive block calls on each element of a collection. The `if..else` statement in the block will invoke puts on the value referenced by `num` if that value being greater than `1` evaluates to `true`, and will just return the referenced value if not. On the first iteration, `1` is not greater than `1` so `1` is returned. But the on second and third iterations `num` references elements that are greater than `1` and so the `puts` invocation line is executed. However as `puts` returns `nil`, the return value of the block on those two iterations will also be `nil`. These three return values in a new array are the return value of this map invocation.



## 11. use select and or reject to return a new array with the same structure as a given array but with only integers that are multiples of 3

```ruby
arr = [[2], [3, 5, 7, 12], [9], [11, 13, 15]]

arr.map do |sub_arr|
  sub_arr.select { |num| num % 3 == 0 }
end

# with #reject

arr.map do |sub_arr|
  sub_arr.reject { |num| num % 3 != 0 }
end


```



## 12. without using #to_h return a hash where the key is the first item in each sub array and the value is the second

```ruby
arr = [[:a, 1], ['b', 'two'], ['sea', {c: 3}], [{a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4}, 'D']]
# expected return value: {:a=>1, "b"=>"two", "sea"=>{:c=>3}, {:a=>1, :b=>2, :c=>3, :d=>4}=>"D"}

arr.each_with_object({}) do |sub_arr, hash|
  hash[sub_arr[0]] = sub_arr[1]
end
```



## 13. return a new array with same sub-arrs but sorted by their contained odd numbers

```ruby
arr = [[1, 6, 9], [6, 1, 7], [1, 8, 3], [1, 5, 9]]

arr.sort_by do |sub_arr|
  sub_arr.select { |num| num.odd? }
end
```



## 14. return an array whose elements are the colors of fruits capitalized and sizes of vegetables upcased.

```ruby
hsh = {
  'grape' => {type: 'fruit', colors: ['red', 'green'], size: 'small'},
  'carrot' => {type: 'vegetable', colors: ['orange'], size: 'medium'},
  'apple' => {type: 'fruit', colors: ['red', 'green'], size: 'medium'},
  'apricot' => {type: 'fruit', colors: ['orange'], size: 'medium'},
  'marrow' => {type: 'vegetable', colors: ['green'], size: 'large'},
}

hsh.map do |food, details|
  if details[:type] == 'fruit'
    details[:colors].map(&:capitalize)
  else
    details[:size].upcase
  end
end
```



## 15. return an array which contains only hashes with all even integers

```ruby
arr = [{a: [1, 2, 3]}, {b: [2, 4, 6], c: [3, 6], d: [4]}, {e: [8], f: [6, 10]}]

arr.select do |hash|
  hash.all? do |_, v|
    v.all? { |num| num.even? }
  end
end
```



## 16. write a method that returns one UUID when called with no parameters

```ruby
def uuid_gen
  chars = %w(0 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9) + ('a'..'f').to_a
  sections = [8, 4, 4, 4, 12]
  
  sections.each_with_object("").with_index do |(section, string), index|
    section.times { string << chars.sample }
    string << "-" unless index >= sections.size - 1
  end
end

p uuid_gen
```
